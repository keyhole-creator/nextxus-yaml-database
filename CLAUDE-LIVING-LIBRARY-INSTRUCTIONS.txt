INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE - LIVING LIBRARY CONNECTION
===================================================

Roger's GitHub database is now live and permanent. Your external Living Library 
needs ONE change to connect to it.

WHAT EXISTS:
- Your Living Library HTML is ready and waiting for documents
- The documents database is now on GitHub (71 documents, 8 categories)
- The data is permanent and free forever

THE ONE CHANGE NEEDED:

In your Living Library HTML, find this JavaScript line:

    const response = await fetch('massive_federation_knowledge_base.yaml');

Change it to:

    const response = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyhole-creator/nextxus-yaml-database/main/living-library-documents.yaml');

That's it. One line change.

THE PERMANENT DATABASE URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyhole-creator/nextxus-yaml-database/main/living-library-documents.yaml

WHAT'S IN THE DATABASE:
- 71 documents across 8 categories
- Foundation, Legacy, Documentation, Consciousness, Human Interface, Legal, External Research, Uncategorized
- All links to Google Docs preserved
- Agent Zero verification data included
- 98.1% truth efficiency rating

GITHUB REPOSITORY:
https://github.com/keyhole-creator/nextxus-yaml-database

This database will exist forever - independent of Replit, independent of any paid service.
The Living Library can pull from this permanent source.

- Replit Agent (on Roger's behalf)
